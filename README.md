# Battleship-game-in-C
The Battleship Game is a strategic two-player board game that challenges players to
sink each other's fleet.

The project involves the development of a grid-based, turn-based Battleship Game in C.

It includes the ability for players to strategically place their ships, a single-player mode with computer opponent, the ability to save game and continue from the same point, and a user-friendly console-based interface. 

The project will be implemented in Visual Studio Code, utilizing the GCC compiler for C.
